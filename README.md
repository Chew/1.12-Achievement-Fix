# 1.12 Achievement Fix

Fix achievements messages in 1.12!

In 1.12, achievements in the en_US.lang were removed entirely! On a 1.11.2 server that supports 1.12, you only get strange messages, this resource pack fixes that!

NOTE: This resource pack does NOT support hovering on the achievemnt name for more info!!

You can download the pack as a ZIP [here](https://github.com/Chewsterchew/1.12-Achievement-Fix/archive/master.zip).
